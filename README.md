Gedit-Menu-Project-Manager
==========================

Provides a menu in gedit to handle groups of files as projects

This is a port of the plugin that existed for version 2.x of gedit. It has been tested only under version 3.8.3 and should not necessarily work with 3.10 and upwards. It could work with versions 3.0-3.6.

Installation is as with other plugins, just drop the two files at /home/nix/.local/share/gedit/plugins.
